    "# Part 2: K-Nearest Neighbors - A Guided Example\n",
    "\n",
    "[K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/17/1/Nearest_Neighbors.html) is a classification algorithm.  Given some numerical *attributes* (also called *features*) of an unseen example, it decides which category that example belongs to based on its similarity to previously seen examples. Predicting the category of an example is called *labeling*, and the predicted category is also called a *label*.\n",
    "\n",
    "An attribute (feature) we have about each movie is *the proportion of times a particular word appears in the movie*, and the labels are two movie genres: comedy and thriller.  The algorithm requires many previously seen examples for which both the attributes and labels are known: that's the `train_movies` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build understanding, we're going to visualize the algorithm instead of just describing it."

    "## 2.1. Classifying a movie\n",
    "\n",
    "In k-NN, we classify a movie by finding the `k` movies in the *training set* that are most similar according to the features we choose. We call those movies with similar features the *nearest neighbors*.  The k-NN algorithm assigns the movie to the most common category among its `k` nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's limit ourselves to just 2 features for now, so we can plot each movie.  The features we will use are the proportions of the words \"water\" and \"feel\" in the movie.  Taking the movie *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* (in the test set), 0.000804074 of its words are \"water\" and 0.0010721 are \"feel\". This movie appears in the test set, so let's imagine that we don't yet know its genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to make our notion of similarity more precise.  We will say that the *distance* between two movies is the straight-line distance between them when we plot their features on a scatter diagram. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This distance is called the Euclidean (\"yoo-KLID-ee-un\") distance, whose formula is $\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the movie *Clerks.* (in the training set), 0.00016293 of all the words in the movie are \"water\" and 0.00154786 are \"feel\".  Its distance from *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* on this 2-word feature set is $\\sqrt{(0.000804074 - 0.000162933)^2 + (0.0010721 - 0.00154786)^2} \\approx 0.000798379$.  (If we included more or different features, the distance could be different.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A third movie, *The Godfather* (in the training set), has 0 \"water\" and 0.00015122 \"feel\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The function below creates a plot to display the \"water\" and \"feel\" features of a test movie and some training movies. As you can see in the result, *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is more similar to *Clerks.* than to the *The Godfather* based on these features, which makes sense as both movies are comedy movies, while *The Godfather* is a thriller."
