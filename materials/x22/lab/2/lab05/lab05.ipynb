    "We can observe all of the February maximum temperatures from 2019 to 2021 (the present period), so we have access to the census; there's no random sampling involved. But, we can imagine that if more years pass with the same present-day climate, there would be different but similar maximum temperatures in future February days. From the data we observe, we can try to estimate the **average maximum February temperature** in this imaginary collection of all future February days that would occur in our modern climate, assuming the climate doesn't change any further and many years pass.\n",

    "We can also imagine that the maximum temperature each day is like a **random draw from a distribution of temperatures for that month**. Treating actual observations of natural events as if they were each *randomly* sampled from some unknown distribution is a simplifying assumption. These temperatures were not actually sampled at random\u2014instead they occurred due to the complex interactions of the Earth's climate\u2014but treating them as if they were random abstracts away the details of this naturally occuring process and allows us to carry out statistical inference.  Conclusions are only as valid as the assumptions upon which they rest, but in this case thinking of daily temperatures as random samples from some unknown climate distribution seems at least plausible.\n",

We intend to compare our confidence interval to the historical average (ie. the `Past` value in our `monthly_increases` table). In all months, the sample average we will consider (i.e. the `Present` value in our `monthly_increases` table) is larger than the historical average. As a result, we know in advance that the upper bound of the confidence interval will be larger as well, and there is no need to compute the upper bound explicitly. (But you can if you wish!)"
